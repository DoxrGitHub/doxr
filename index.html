    <p id="heytype2">If the title didn't tell you, I'm Izaan (I go online as "doxr") and I like coding (I'm a fullstack developer). It all started with Scratch and then went to HTML. That's when I started learning everything about HTML/CSS myself, which lead to me learning more, and I found other cool people who helped with my understanding of things. I like making random project and breaking ChromiumOS/Chromebooks. <b>Almost everything I make is open source (licensed under ISC, GPL/AGPL, or MIT).</b></p><br><marquee>ðŸš§ðŸš§ THIS SITE IS IN CONTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš§</marquee><!--

        <h4><b>TalkRN</b></h4> 
        <p>TalkRN is a web chatting application build on Node.js and Express.js. Features include auto-moderation, moderation commands, and roles/ranking with minimal code modification. Banning and muting are included, as are moderators and owner only commands. Oh, and AI bots and flairs!<br><br>You *need* Replit to run this, as ReplDB and Repl Auth are involved.</p>

          <h4><b>DoxrForm</b></h4> 
          <p>DoxrForm is a small project I worked on. It features a very simple form for the user, and a minimal admin panel with certain cool powers. There is authentication for the admin, and it is encouraged to modify the form to your own needs.<br><br>This is more for a casual "contact me" form than it is a form for quizzes, simply because of how it was built.</p>

          <h4><b>GPTrolley revive</b></h4> 
          <p>GPTrolley is a remake of the original GPTrolley (which is down, https://gptrolley.com) except completely remade by me. This uses the Deepinfra AI API which offers open source models without an API key - using this, I could make a revival that mimics the functionality of the original. (This isn't a complete remake since a lot of proportions are weird).</p>
